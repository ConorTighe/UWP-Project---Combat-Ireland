In the 600s BC, the major empires in the Middle East favored larger armies centered around archery, chariots and quick moving light infantry that worked well on large open battlefields. The Greeks however lived in a mountainous country, were battles were fought in ravines, valleys and mountain passes with heavy infantry at close quarters.
With military service being obligatory for citizenship in the Greek polis, the average Greek man was well-versed in close combat.

Out of the clash of phalanxes came a combat art based on real combat experiences that combined wrestling and striking. 
This art, Pankration, was practiced in varying forms from Greek city-state to Greek city-state, and included joint locks, 
chokes and neck cranks.

To fill the time during years of peace, Greeks had sporting contests, mostly based around preparing Greek men for war.
Pankration was a natural addition and appeared in the Olympic games. Rules varied from city to city and there is evidence that 
Spartans were outlawed from most competitions for their unfortunate tendency to kill their opponent and that they were encouraged 
by their teachers to bite and scratch in matches.

Matches, in general, were fought naked and combatants coated themselves with sand to create friction for grips. 
Fighters then could strike or grapple, depending on their own personal style and matches ended when one contestant was 
unable to continue or signaled defeat by raising an index finger on one hand (an ancient tapout). Death was a fairly common 
occurrence in these matches.
