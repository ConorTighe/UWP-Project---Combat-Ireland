## Overview

This is an app that lets you add drills to your different fighting style training sessions along with updating and deleting them from the database, I use Toast notification to tell the user when these actions are complete. Each drill category has an info tab about the fighting style and its origins. You can also use the maps feature to find gyms in your local area to find somewhere to train the drills. There is also a News section for the latest combat sports news. The app follows the MVVP deign pattern and uses the newest version of the UWP Toolkit for a modern and adaptive UI across all devices.
