The origin of Muay Thai, as a fighting style, is thought to have developed for centuries as tribes migrated 
south from the steppes of China through Vietnam, Laos, Burma, and Cambodia. The major tribes of that period, 
one of which was the (Tai) Siamese, fought fiercely to survive as they moved south and encountered other smaller 
tribes in what is now northern and central Thailand, and as far south as Malaysia. Through training, loss of life, 
military tactics, and hand-to-hand combat,
technique and tactics were honed to a razors edge, and the rudimentary elements of a "fighting-style" began to take root.

Older soldiers and fathers taught their students and sons the offensive and defensive tactics and techniques,
proper posture and position, and skills to enhance awareness. Those students and sons went on to teach their children, 
and the roots and permanent structure of an "effective fighting-style" began to strengthen. Proper technique and power strikes
were a vital element in war that requires hand-to-hand skills. Each strike and movement is meant to deliever a debilitating and 
crushing blow, and enable the fighter to move on to the next opponent quickly without leaving himself exposed to an attack.

It would seem that the evolution of the most-effective hand-to-hand form of combat evolved in a rather Darwin-like manner demanding
survival of the fittest: those who fought well.......lived and taught others before falling themselves.

The Thai were on constant guard against attack from neighboring countries, including Burma and Cambodia. Enemies for centuries, 
the Burmese and Thai fought several wars wreaking destruction on both countries. Muay Thai was primarily a part of the Thai culture 
during this period and was a mandatory training as part of the Thai military of that time. The military continued to train 
soldiers for centuries in the art of Muay Thai: defining, and refining the skills, tactics, and techniques with the wars against 
the Burmese, Cambodians, and other invaders.

Young Thai men returning from a tour of duty with the military soon engaged in matches for sport and fun in villages and towns. 
Each province, town, and village would support a local fighter who showed some promise and skill. Older warriors, survivors of many 
battles and engagements of the enemy, became Muay Thai instructors and teachers [ Kroo Muay]. The love of the sport, and a need for 
the defense of the kingdom made Muay Thai a part of the Thai culture for the next 500 years as generation after generation passed the 
skills on to the next.

WAI KROO/RAM MUAY

The tradition of the Wai Kroo dates back several centuries. The Wai Kroo is a ritualistic and traditional dance carried 
out before Muay Thai fighters engage in the ring. The Wai Kroo is meant to show honor to the fighters teacher, the sport of 
Muay Thai, and his country. The Ram Muay is the dance that is unique to each Master instructor who teaches his students. 
The student will dance in each direction of the ring approaching and touching the corner posts with a prayer, showing respect 
to his opponent and to the spirits.

MODERN MUAY THAI

Muay Thai has come a long way in the last 100 years. Because of the great national popularity, Muay Thai began to garner 
international exposure and recognition. In World War II, Thai soldiers were stationed overseas, and foreigners recieved their 
first good look at Muay Thai firsthand. Muay Thai was named by foreigners as Siam Boxing, as Thailand was formerly Siam. During WW II,
the French labeled Muay Thai as "Le Sport Orient" or the fighting style of the orient. The Thai soldiers participating in the war 
would practice Muay Thai among themselves as soldiers from Europe and America watched with great interest. Until that time, Muay Thai 
was a cultural gem, hidden within this strange and wonderful culture of this country called Thailand.

Soldiers from abroad were so impressed of the Muay Thai fighting style that they asked the Thai soldiers to teach them 
the basics and traditions of Muay Thai. As Muay Thai became more popular, especially with an international interest, the rules 
began to changge to become more inline with other goverened sports like boxing. In the 1920's, the roots of modern Muay Thai were 
planted when rings were introduced replacing open courtyards.The old-style horsehide, hemp rope, or leather bindings were 
replaced with gloves similar to boxing. In the past, fighters were known to soak their hemp rope bindings in a sticky resin and 
then dip their hands in crushed glass and ash that could attack the opponents eyesight. [As appeared in the movie "Kickboxer" 
starring Jean-Claude Van Dame] A hard-cover groin protector was also added for the fighters protection from brutal kicks and knees.

After the end of WW II, the first formal rules were introduced into the sport. Fights were divided into 5 rounds, and time 
limits were imposed on each round. Time was counted on a clock rather than the old style of a coconut shell with holes sinking 
completely in a barrel of water. Major stadiums for Muay Thai were constructed after the war in large cities [Bangkok, Sukothai,
Chiang Mai] throughout the country as the popularity of Muay Thai grew. Lumpini Stadium in Bangkok is now almost considered 
"holy ground" to the multitudes of Thai fighters, and now many foreigners, trying to win a place on a fight card. A system of 
weight-classes, defined rules, and championships was devised in the years ahead as Muay Thai began to resemble boxing in style and 
organization.

The typical Muay Thai fighter here in Thailand trains many hours everyday. Many fighters will fight every 3-4 weeks just 
to be able to support their family. Unlike boxing in Europe and America, Muay Thai fighters make very little money from each fight.
A typical Muay Thai fighter may bring home 4000-6000 baht ($100 - $150) every month from fighting which is barely enough to 
support one person, much less a family.

Muay Thai fighters often begin training when they are 6-8 years-old. They will begin fighting between 8-10 years of age and 
may have as many as 120-150 fights ( 3 times as many as a very active boxer ) before they are 24 years old. Muay Thai fighters 
do not generally have long careers because of starting at such an early age and how physically demanding the sport is on the fighters.
Injuries are quite common in Muay Thai fights. From cuts and lacerations to the face and head to broken bones and severe sprains 
of muscles and ligaments, Muay Thai fighters deal with injuries their entire career. Muay Thai fighters are known for their ability 
to ignore pain and injury.

Today, the evolution of Muay Thai is finally reaping rewards and recognition. Muay Thai was recently accepted as an Olympic sport,
and it is becoming quite popular in many countries throughout the world. Professional fighters in martial arts, K-1, and submission
fighting all agree, Muay Thai is an essential part of being an all-around skilled fighter and having stand-up fighting skills. 
Muay Thai will continue to grow in popularity as new training camps and gyms open around the world.
