The origins of Full Contact Kickboxing can be found in Thailand in the 2,000 year old discipline of Muay Thai fighting. 
Thai boxing was devised, initially, for self-defence. It only developed into a sport when unarmed combat in warfare 
became less and less effective. It remains the national sport of Thailand. Thai boxers are awarded the same superstar 
status in their home nation as premier league footballers in Europe or basketball players in the USA. Full Contact Kickboxing 
developed through a combination of Muay Thai and other martial art influences.

It was aided in its rise, when Bruce Lee exploded onto the big screen. 
The first time anything resembling what we now know as Full Contact Kickboxing began in the United States in the 
early 1970's as Full Contact Karate. In September 1974, in Los Angeles, the first ever World Championships of Full Contact 
Karate were hosted. At that time Karate's own sanctioning body, the PKA, provided the official nod that was required.

The bouts took place on a standard karate surface (no ring). Some of the best traditional Karate fighters of North America 
tried their hand at this fresh take on their ancient art. It wasn't until the late 1970's that the sport moved into a boxing ring.
Initially, there were only weight 4 divisions. The first Full Contact World Champions were the legendary Jeff Smith, Joe Lewis, 
Bill Wallace & Isuena Duenas. From 1974 until 1985, the PKA was the most widely-recognised world-wide sanctioning group, 
even though it operated mainly in the USA.

Don & Judy Quine, along with Joe Corley, helped it on its way and were instrumental in establishing the first links with television. 
Their contract with the American TV network ESPN helped take the burgeoning sport to a wider audience. The PKA developed the 
first fighter ratings systems and presented their champions with a very real and very high profile. Jean-Yves Theriault, Brad Hefton, 
Jerry Trimble, Steve Shepard and others became the first stars of this new regulated sport.

The roots of the sport in Europe were planted in Germany. In 1975, an amateur organisation to rival the PKA appeared. 
The WAKO (WORLD ALL STYLE KARATE ORGANIZATION) was created by Georges Bruckner and was the only international amateur federation 
in Europe. Over the next decade a myriad of sanctioning bodies came and went - all claiming to represent the best interests of the 
fighters and the sport. WAKO has developed into the leading amateur federation in kickboxing. WAKO was taken over by Italian Ennio 
Falson in the late 1970’s.

Under the guidance of Mike Anderson a professional branch - the PKO (PROFESSIONAL KICKBOXING ORGANIZATION) - soon emerged. It was 
short-lived however and when Anderson retired, in 1991, it was replaced by the IKL (INTERNATIONAL KICKBOXING LEAGUE), which itself 
lasted only a few years. The WORLD KICKBOXING ASSOCIATION (WKA) was created in 1976 by Howard Hanson, a Shorin Ryu Karate black belt
and student of Mike Stone. It developed the field of low kicks thanks to some strong Asian connections and good promotions in Japan.
The WKA also prospered in Europe. Champions like Rob Kaman, Fred Royers, Ivan Sprang and Ronnie Green emerged over a decade ago and 
remain planted in the memory. When Howard HANSON sold the WKA to Canadian Dale Floyd in 1991 its North American activity started to 
fade. Newly appointed European directors Fred Royers from Holland and Jean-Paul Maillet from France left in January 1994 when Paul 
Ingram took over the prestigious federation and established its World headquarters in the UK. At the time, WKA was the second 
largest professional sanctioning organisation in the World.
